//There are different ways to guard routes. this is an example of a guard that prevents a route from being activated, 
//which is implemented as a class that defines a canActivate method. The implementation of this method uses the context objects that 
//Angular provides that describe the route that is about to be navigated to and checks to see whether the target component is a StoreComponent.
//If this is the first time that the canActivate method has been called and a different component is about to be used, then the Router.navigateByUrl method
//is used to navigate to the root URL.The @Injectable decorator has been applied in the listing because route guards are services.
//registers the guard as a service using the root moduleâ€™s providers property and guards each route using the canActivate property.
